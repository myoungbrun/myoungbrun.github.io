### Climate change damages on labor and capital, inequality, and the social cost of carbon
_with Simon Feindt_ (MCC)

_Abstract_ : Climate change is poised to generate economic damages through many channels, in particular through shocks to the factors of production. We use an integrated assessment model with sub-regional inequality and introduce direct impacts on capital and productive labor stocks, resulting in endogenously persistent damages. We model and calibrate the joint distribution of labor and capital income, to capture the role played by income composition heterogeneity in within-region inequality. The income-elasticity of damages has a stronger impact than their persistence on future inequality, consumption, and optimal policy. When taking the non-proportionality of damages into account, inequality increases with labor productivity and capital damages, but labor impacts tend to have a stronger effect. In the most affected regions, these factor-specific damages can lead to dramatic consumption losses at the bottom of the distribution, resulting in a large increase in the social cost of carbon.


### The political economy of carbon taxation with vertical and horizontal inequality

_Abstract_ : This paper investigates the role of urban-rural inequalities in shaping political support for carbon taxation. I develop a model of majority voting over a carbon tax, with both income and urban-rural heterogeneity. The heterogeneity in tax burden between urban and rural households is captured through different amounts of subsistence consumption of the emission-intensive good. I analyze the distributional impact of recycling the proceedings of the tax and ask whether this redistribution is likely to increase political support. 

Calibration of the model to twenty European countries shows that the tax rate supported by a majority tends to be lower than the optimal tax rate. Political support is in some cases much lower among rural households, implying polarized public support for the carbon tax. Lump-sum transfers render the tax and rebate scheme progressive but have only a small impact on overall political support.
