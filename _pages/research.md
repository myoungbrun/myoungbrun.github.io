### Climate change damages on labor and capital, inequality, and the social cost of carbon
_with Simon Feindt_

_Abstract_ : Climate change is poised to generate economic damages through many channels, in particular through shocks to the factors of production. We modify an integrated assessment model with sub-regional inequality and introduce direct impacts on capital and productive labor stocks, resulting in endogenously persistent damages. We model and calibrate the joint distribution of labor and capital income, to capture the role played by income composition heterogeneity in within-region inequality. The income-elasticity of damages has a stronger impact than their persistence on future inequality, consumption, and optimal policy. When taking the non-proportionality of damages into account, inequality increases with labor productivity and capital damages, but labor impacts tend to have a stronger effect. In the most affected regions, these factor-specific damages can lead to dramatic consumption losses at the bottom of the distribution, resulting in a large increase in the social cost of carbon.

### The political economy of carbon taxation with vertical and horizontal inequality

_Abstract_ : This paper investigates how voting over a carbon tax is impacted by the distribution of the tax burden. I introduce both income and urban-rural inequalities in a majority voting framework. Urban and rural voters differ by the amount of carbon-intensive subsistence consumption. The analytical results show (i) the vote is more likely to be polarized around the urban-rural divide if incomes are less spread or society as a whole depends less on polluting consumption; and (ii) the majority tax rate may be larger than the pigouvian rate when the income inequality is stronger than the urban-rural inequality. I further calibrate the model using European data and explore complementary climate policies to carbon taxation and their effect on majority voting carbon taxation.
