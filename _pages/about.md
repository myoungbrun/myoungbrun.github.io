I am a PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu) and [CES](http://centredeconomiesorbonne.univ-paris1.fr/) (Sorbonne Economics Center), co-supervised by Stéphane Zuber (CNRS, CES) and Aurélie Méjean ([CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr/fr/)).

My main research field is Environmental and Climate Change Economics.

I study climate change impacts and mitigation policies, with a focus on their distributive effects. I use theory and integrated assessment modeling to investigate the welfare impacts of climate policies and the political constraints on their implementation.

**I am on the 2022-2023 Job Market.**
