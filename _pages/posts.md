Some tips and tricks I've gathered along the way. 

### Workflow and tools

* How this website is made: forked from [Academic pages with github](https://academicpages.github.io/), with a guide [here](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/)
* Easily making graphs that are compatible with LaTeX (graphs exportable as tikz): [mathcha.io](https://www.mathcha.io/)
* Extracting tables from pdf files: [tabula](https://tabula.technology/)

<!--- Bibliography with Zotero and saving articles from the browser
* Writing What You See Is What You Get (i.e. easier) LateX with LyX -->

### R 

* World and regional country maps with [Rworldmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rworldmap/vignettes/rworldmap.pdf)
* _Relative_ paths in R with [here](https://here.r-lib.org/): the (very welcome) end of "setwd()"
