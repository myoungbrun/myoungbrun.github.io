Some ressources and tricks I've gathered along the way. 

### Workflow and tools

* How this website is made: forked from [Academic pages with github](https://academicpages.github.io/), with a guide [here](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/)
* Easily making graphs that are compatible with LaTeX (graphs exportable as tikz): [mathcha.io](https://www.mathcha.io/)
* A table generator for LaTex, Markdown and html: [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/)
* Visualizing tool for literature searches: [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)

### Reproducibility 

* Version control with git (for economists) by Lu√≠s Fonseca: [slides](https://luispfonseca.com/files/slides_git.pdf)

### R 

* World and regional country maps with [Rworldmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rworldmap/vignettes/rworldmap.pdf)
* _Relative_ paths in R with [here](https://here.r-lib.org/): the (very welcome) end of "setwd()"

### Julia

* Data Frames [performance tips](https://juliadatascience.io/df_performance) 
* Creating and working with [environments](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/)

### Advice posts
