Some miscellaneous tips and tricks I've gathered along the way. 

Workflow and tools 
* How this website is made 
* Bibliography with Zotero and saving articles from the browser
* Writing What You See Is What You Get (i.e. easier) LateX with LyX
* Making graphs with mathcha.io (exportable to tikz)


R 
* World and regional country maps with Rworldmap
* Relative paths in R for collaboration with here: the end of "setwd()"
